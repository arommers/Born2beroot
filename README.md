# Born2beroot

Born2BeRoot is an exercise in hands-on experience in system administration and security, specifically focusing on Linux environments.
In this project we install and configure a virtual machine to be a server. Configuration includes among other things:
Setting up a firewall, configuring user accounts and permissions, setting up monitoring and more.

#### Virtual Box
To be able to configure anything we need to have an up and running system.  
To this end we first download and install: [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  

VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. It essentially acts as a "virtual computer" within our existing computer, so we can mess about without endangering our actual computer.

The next thing we need is an operation system. The [subject file](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/82536/en.subject.pdf) gives us the option to choose between either the latest stable version of Debian (no testing/unstable), or the latest stable version of Rocky. I chose Debian: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
